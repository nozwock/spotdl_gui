## Usage
### Searches
You can search for multiple items at a time by separating them with a comma `','`. \
For example: `Aurora, Coolio, Full Confession`.

To use a comma as part of your search term without it acting as a separator, you can escape it with the backslash character `'\'`. \
For example: `This here\, will be escaped` will be treated as a literal string `This here, will be escaped`.

#### Reserved search terms
| Term                 | Description                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `user:saved-tracks`  | Spotify user's favourite tracks |
| `user:all-playlists` | Spotify user's all playlists    |

#### Search prefixes
| Prefix      | Description        |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| `album:`    | Search by album    |
| `playlist:` | Search by playlist |
| `artist:`   | Search by artist   |
